\chapter{Introduction}
Currently available platform such as the TurtleBot\cite{turtlebot} are either too small or too expensive\cite{turtlebotcost}, so for the project focus of an autonomous robot tour guide, a custom mobile sensor platform needs to be developed.

The custom sensor platform will also allow for a more intimate knowledge of the system, making for smoother integration of any future sensors and easier modifications or repairs.

For testing and map-building purposes, the platform will need remote manual control, as well as a \gls{pid} loop for more accurate speed control. Wheel position encoders and Odometry will also be needed for position feedback to the control system.

The report aims to explain the methodology and reasoning behind the actions taken to produce a custom mobile sensor platform.
